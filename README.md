I am a Physics Ph.D student at Ohio University. My research is mainly about the Astrophysics galaxy cluster simulations.
Besides physics I am highly interested in Data Analysis and Machine Learning. I am fluent in Python and have lots of experience with Bash, LaTex, Fortran and Python packages.

This repo mainly serves as a collections of my learning and find outs such as "how did I installed some packages?",   "how to use some programs?" and so on.

I shamelessly copied the idea from evanwill's tutorial.

With GitHub pages and Jekyll you can quickly create and publish a website for free! 
It is an ideal solution for creating a simple project or personal site to highlight

You will learn how to set up a project directory, write content in Markdown, 
and publish your site, all using GitHub's user friendly web interface.

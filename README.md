I shamelessly copied the idea from evan will tutorial.

With GitHub pages and Jekyll you can quickly create and publish a website for free! It is an ideal solution for creating a simple project or personal site to highlight your academic work. This workshop will introduce the basics of using the popular static website generator Jekyll integrated with GitHub pages. You will learn how to set up a project directory, write content in Markdown, and publish your site, all using GitHub's user friendly web interface.
